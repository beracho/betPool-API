## The why

This project is meant to show you the quality of my work, showing you a simple project using the technologies I'm most familiar with, since the initial creation of the project until deployment in a server. While the project is in development, I'll walk you through the process, designing the project, creating the requirements of the system and the tasks tracker. In that way you can have a glince of my organization habits while working on a project, you can see the Notion page related to this project [here](https://www.notion.so/Budget-Manager-f6aefd843f364d76b6d906898f9017f8?pvs=4).

## The how
This is a Web application is divided in Back-end and Front-end. The Back-end is working with an REST API server using .NET 8, Entity Framework, SQL Server on a webapi template. The Front-end is develped with ReactJs, Javascript and CSS. For deployment I will use Azure or AWS, it will be decided once I have the minimum viable product.

## The what
The main purpose of the system is to create a budget administrator, that allows users to register their accounts and their expenses, set saving goals with the amount and date.

This project will manage the transactions using accounting entries, so we can make sure every entry respects the basic economic principles. In that way we can pave the way to a bigger system application in the future.

### Functionalities
Functionalities will be updated as the project grows.
- User self management (Account creation, Login, Password recovery).
- Account management, CRUD with validations.
- Transaction management, CRUD for transactions with entries update.
- Show total income and expenses in a period of time.
